# 🌳 Day 83 — GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔄 Problem: Mirror Tree
### 📌 Problem Brief:
Transform a given binary tree into its mirror image by swapping the left and right subtrees recursively.

## 🧠 Solution Strategy:
✅ Applied a classic post-order traversal
✅ Recursively traversed both left and right subtrees
✅ Swapped root.left and root.right after child calls
✅ Used tuple unpacking for elegant one-liner swap
